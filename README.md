# Funny_Python
Some Python scripts coded just for fun.

"anagram.py" takes 2 words as parameters.
It returns if the words are anagrams or not.

"leet_speak_convertissor.py" takes a text and it returns
the same text in the leet speak alphabet.

"FizzBuzz.py" returns a number or 'Fizz' or 'Buzz'
or 'FizzBuzz' for each number below 100.
It depends if the number is a multiple of 3, of 5, 
both or none of them.

"scraper.py" is a basic web scraper coded with
the Scrapy frameworks.
